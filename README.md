# animaroller

An up-to-date jar can be found in the artifacts folder above the ones listed in directories called "release *.*". This jar
is build as part of the compile process, so whenever I compile to test something it is remade.

# Using the Tool
Firstly, you will have to fill out the JSON files for the characters (player and npc's), weapons, and armor that you will use for the game. Open the files in a text editor such as TextEdit (MAC) or Notepad (Windows) to edit the file. I reccomend using Notepad++ (its free if you dont have it), or an IDE if you have one installed.

Once you've filled out the JSON files, run the program. You can edit the files while it is running and reload them into the tool with the "reload" command.

Launch the jar from your preferred terminal or run the .sh or .bat files. The .sh file may require elevation to executable status google "make sh file executable" for more info.
