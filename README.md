An up-to-date jar can be found in the artifacts folder above the ones listed in directories called "release *.*". This jar
is build as part of the compile process, so whenever I compile to test something it is remade.

At the moment, the jar must be run from a console to work properly, as it relies on console based input and output, and a
console window does not open automatically when double-clicking a jar. I will look for solutions/workarounds/alternate ways of
doing I/O.
